# Functional-Programming
#Square-Python Funcitonal Programming

## Description

This goal provides an introduction to functional programming concepts using JavaScript and gives you the opportunity to practice these concepts with a series of reinforcement exercises from the [Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](https://drboolean.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/content/) and a handful of automated challenges on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/latest/my-languages?tags=Functional+Programming).

## Context

Functional programming patterns are becoming increasingly popular in the web development community. Using these patterns results in code that is more adaptable and flexible, less buggy, and more scalable. 

The article [The Two Pillars of JavaScriptâ€Š: Pt 2: Functional Programming
How to Stop Micromanaging Everything](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-two-pillars-of-javascript-pt-2-functional-programming-a63aa53a41a4#.p9gfmzfel) goes into many of the reasons why you might want to consider learning how to write JavaScript as a functional programmer would.

## Specifications

- [x] Read the [Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](https://drboolean.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/content/) through Chapter 8: Tupperware
- [ ] Complete the exercises in the Mostly Adequate Guide (note: there aren't exercises after each chapter - just the ones on Ch 4: Currying, Ch: 5: Coding by Composing, and Ch: 8 Tupperware).
- [x] Practice these concepts by completing at least [5 Functional Programming exercises](https://www.codewars.com/kata/latest/my-languages?tags=Functional+Programming) on 

-OR-

- [ ] Refactor a previous project to use functional programming patterns (strongly recommended to review the Mostly Adequate Guide before starting) 

CodeWars (just a heads up: you're required to answer a couple of super basic JS questions to sign up for CodeWars). BONUS: Do more if you get through 5 exercises by the end of the cycle.

 
### Required

## Fun with Lists: Reduce 
https://www.codewars.com/kata/fun-with-lists-reduce

Description:

Implement the method reduce, which accepts three arguments:

linked list (head)
bi-function - (accumulated_value, current_element_data)
initial value

This method should return the result of applying the given function on every element with the accumulating result, starting with the initial value.

For example:

Given the list: 1 -> 2 -> 3, the function (acc, curr) => acc + curr and an initial value of 0, reduce should return 6, because:

(0, 1) and the function (acc, curr) => acc + curr gives 1
(1, 2) and the function (acc, curr) => acc + curr gives 3
(3, 3) and the function (acc, curr) => acc + curr gives 6

Another example:

Given the list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4, the function (acc, curr) => acc * curr and an initial value of 1, reduce should return 24

## Solution

```function reduce (head, f, init){
  var accumulated = init
  var current = head

  if(current === null){return f(accumulated,head)}
  
 while(current.next !== null && current !== null) {
    accumulated = f(accumulated, current.data)
    current = current.next
  }
  
  if(current.next === null){
    accumulated = f(accumulated, current.data)
  }
  
 return accumulated
}```
